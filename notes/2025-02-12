I am ready for my advanced linux journey. I have lots of plans for notes, tutorial, and learning experiments for my local linux work computer, my server, my vm's, and everything in between.

First I have to lay down a list of all the tasks I want to do, then reorder them in category and severity in order to have an ordered list of tasks to complete, experiment, and document.

I will create a folder [todo] and there I will have a file with an unordered list of tasks, and later I will order them bit by bit in an ordered list there.
